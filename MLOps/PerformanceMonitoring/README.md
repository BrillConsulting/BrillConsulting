# Performance Monitoring

Real-time monitoring of ML model performance, latency, throughput, and resource utilization with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Overview

Performance monitoring tracks operational metrics: latency (P50/P95/P99), throughput (RPS), resource usage (CPU/GPU/Memory), and error rates.

## Key Metrics

- Latency: P50, P95, P99 response times
- Throughput: Requests per second
- Resource: CPU, Memory, GPU utilization
- Errors: Error rate, timeout rate, 4xx/5xx errors

## Optimization Techniques

- Model quantization and compression
- Batching for throughput
- Caching frequent predictions
- Load balancing

## Tools

- Prometheus + Grafana
- DataDog, New Relic
- Locust for load testing
