# Pipeline Orchestration

Workflow orchestration and automation for ML pipelines using Apache Airflow and other orchestration tools.

## Overview

Pipeline orchestration manages complex ML workflows, handling dependencies, scheduling, retry logic, and monitoring. Essential for production ML operations with Apache Airflow, Kubeflow, and Prefect.

## Key Features

- **DAG Management**: Visual workflow representation
- **Task Dependencies**: Complex dependency graphs
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based, event-driven, manual triggers
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with backoff
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline execution tracking
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent task execution

## Apache Airflow Example

Core concepts: DAGs, Operators, Tasks, Dependencies, XCom for data passing between tasks.

## Tools

- Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, Prefect, Dagster, Argo Workflows
