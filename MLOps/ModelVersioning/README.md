# Model Versioning

Version control for ML models using DVC and MLflow, tracking changes, lineage, and enabling reproducibility.

## Overview

Model versioning tracks all changes to models over time with Git, DVC, and MLflow, ensuring reproducibility and enabling rollbacks.

- Training code and notebooks
- Training data versions
- Dependencies (requirements.txt)
- Hyperparameters and configs
- Performance metrics
