# Linux Performance Tuning

Complete system performance optimization for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network.

## Features

- CPU tuning (governors, turbo boost, affinity)
- Memory optimization (swappiness, cache pressure, huge pages)
- Disk I/O tuning (schedulers, read-ahead, queue depth)
- Network optimization (TCP tuning, BBR congestion control)
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking

## Technologies

- cpupower, tuned
- sysctl kernel parameters
- I/O schedulers (mq-deadline, BFQ, kyber)
- TCP BBR congestion control
- perf, sar, iostat monitoring tools

## Use Cases

- High-performance computing
- Database servers optimization
- Web server tuning
- Network throughput optimization
- Latency-sensitive applications
