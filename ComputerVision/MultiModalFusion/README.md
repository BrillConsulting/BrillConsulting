# Multi-Modal Fusion

Combine information from multiple modalities (vision, text, audio) for enhanced understanding.

## Features

- **Cross-Modal Attention**: Attention between different modalities
- **Tensor Fusion**: Outer product-based fusion
- **Bilinear Fusion**: Pairwise interaction modeling
- **Multi-Modal Transformer**: Transformer-based fusion
- **CLIP-style Learning**: Contrastive vision-language alignment
- **Modality Gating**: Adaptive weighting of modalities

## Methods

### Fusion Strategies
1. Early fusion (concatenation)
2. Late fusion (decision-level)
3. Hybrid fusion (cross-modal attention)
4. Tensor fusion (high-order interactions)

## Applications

- Audio-visual recognition
- Vision-language tasks
- Medical imaging with reports
- Robotics with multi-sensor fusion

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
