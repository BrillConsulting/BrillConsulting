# Neural Rendering

Novel view synthesis and 3D scene representation using neural networks.

## Features

- **NeRF**: Neural Radiance Fields for 3D scenes
- **Instant-NGP**: Fast NeRF with hash encoding
- **Neural Textures**: Learnable texture maps
- **PlenOctrees**: Real-time NeRF rendering
- **Volume Rendering**: Differentiable rendering

## Methods

### NeRF
- Positional encoding
