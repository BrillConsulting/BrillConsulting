# Video Object Segmentation

Segment and track objects across video frames.

## Features

- **Space-Time Memory (STM)**: Memory-based segmentation
- **AOT**: Associating Objects with Transformers
- **Mask Propagation**: Propagate masks across frames

## Methods

### STM
- Memory encoding and retrieval
- Attention-based matching
- Semi-supervised tracking

### AOT
- Transformer-based association
- Object queries
- End-to-end learning

## Applications

- Video editing
- Augmented reality
- Sports analytics
- Autonomous driving

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
