## 📋 About Me

I'm an AI Consultant and Data Scientist passionate about turning data into strategy.  
For me, artificial intelligence is not just about algorithms — it's about **understanding context, solving problems, and creating value that lasts**.

With years of experience across AI, MLOps, and advanced analytics, I bridge the gap between technology and business impact.  
I design intelligent systems that empower organizations to make smarter, faster, and more ethical decisions.

When I'm not training models, I'm usually training minds — sharing knowledge, mentoring teams, and building the next generation of data-driven leaders.
